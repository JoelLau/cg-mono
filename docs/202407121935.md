# Choice of FE Framework

> Implementation of advanced, refactorable UI design components using popular frameworks. 
- src: [requirements](https://gitlab.com/coingecko-dev-test/link-shortener/-/blame/master/README.md#L31)

## Considerations

- Rails ships with ERB that can render a full-stack applications
    - ✅ comes with great defaults (e.g. CSRF tokens)
    - ✅ simplifies CI/CD and infra
    - ❌ ERB documentation seems sparse
    - ❌ **3 days to complete, no time to pick up new framework** (poor, but practical reason)
- React
    - ✅ meets criteria for "advanced", "refactorable" and "popular"
    - ✅ matches Coingecko's tech stack
    - ❌ **3 days to complete, no time to pick up new framework** (poor, but practical reason)
- **Angular**
    - ✅ I know this well


## Supporting FE Libraries

- **Font Awesome**: biggest choice of icons (i'm choosing convenience > performance due to short timeline)
- **ESLint / Prettier**: enforce coding standards
- **TailwindCSS**: for modern look, match coingecko.com
- **Playwright**: explicit await/async, no strong reason to pick this over cypress
